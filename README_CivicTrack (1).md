 CivicTrack – Hackathon Project

 Problem Statement 2

Empower citizens to easily report and track local issues (e.g., road damage, water leaks, garbage overflow) with location-based filtering and status tracking.



 Problem Summary
The civic infrastructure in urban areas faces frequent challenges—potholes, water supply issues, broken lights, etc.—yet most of these go unreported or unresolved due to lack of an effective platform. **CivicTrack** provides a user-friendly system to report, track, and manage such issues efficiently, encouraging citizen participation and improved municipal response.



 Key Features

 Features Visibility
- Issues visible only within a **3–5 km radius** using GPS/manual location.
- User can’t interact with reports outside their zone.

 Quick Issue Reporting
- Report with title, description, photos (up to 3), and category.
- Supports **anonymous** or **verified** reporting.

 Supported Categories
- Roads (potholes, obstructions)  
- Lighting (broken/flickering lights)  
- Water Supply (leaks, low pressure)  
- Cleanliness (overflowing bins, garbage)  
- Public Safety (open manholes, exposed wiring)  
- Obstructions (fallen trees, debris)



 Map Mode & Filtering

- Issues displayed as pins on map (Leaflet.js or Google Maps).
- Filter by:
  - Status: `Reported`, `In Progress`, `Resolved`
  - Category
  - Distance: 1 km, 3 km, 5 km



 Status Tracking
- Issues have status logs and timestamps.
- Reporters get notified on status updates.



 Moderation & Safety
- Spam/irrelevant reports can be flagged.
- Multiple flags auto-hide issues pending review.



 Admin Role
- Manage and review reports.
- Access issue analytics.
- Ban abusive users.

 Key Code Snippets

 1. Location-Based Filtering (PostgreSQL + PostGIS)
sql
-- Find all issues within a 3km radius from a given point
SELECT * FROM issues 
WHERE ST_DWithin(location, ST_MakePoint($1, $2)::geography, 3000);
```



 2. Issue Reporting (Express + Sequelize)
```js
// controllers/issueController.js
exports.createIssue = async (req, res) => {
  const { title, description, category, location, photoURL, isAnonymous } = req.body;
  if (!title || !category || !location) return res.status(400).json({ error: "Missing fields" });

  const newIssue = await Issue.create({ title, description, category, location, photo_url: photoURL, is_anonymous: isAnonymous });
  res.status(201).json(newIssue);
};
```



 3. Displaying Map Pins (React + Leaflet.js)
```js
<Map center={[latitude, longitude]} zoom={13}>
  {issues.map((issue) => (
    <Marker key={issue.id} position={[issue.location.lat, issue.location.lng]}>
      <Popup>{issue.title}</Popup>
    </Marker>
  ))}
</Map>
```



 4. JWT Authentication Middleware
```js
// middleware/auth.js
const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken");

module.exports = function(req, res, next) {
  const token = req.header("Authorization");
  if (!token) return res.status(401).send("Access Denied");

  try {
    const verified = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
    req.user = verified;
    next();
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(400).send("Invalid Token");
  }
};




 5. Admin: Ban a User
```js
// controllers/adminController.js
exports.banUser = async (req, res) => {
  const { userId } = req.params;
  await User.update({ banned: true }, { where: { id: userId }});
  res.send("User banned");
};
```


 6. Flagging a Report
```js
// routes/flagRoute.js
router.post("/flag/:issueId", async (req, res) => {
  const issue = await Issue.findByPk(req.params.issueId);
  issue.flags += 1;

  if (issue.flags >= 3) {
    issue.hidden = true; // auto-hide after 3 flags
  }

  await issue.save();
  res.send("Report flagged.");
});
```



7. Admin Analytics Query
```sql
-- Count issues by category
SELECT category, COUNT(*) as total FROM issues GROUP BY category;

-- Most active areas (heatmap prep)
SELECT ST_AsText(location), COUNT(*) FROM issues GROUP BY location;
```
